# Kill This Lab | Lab Reservation System
Welcome to our Lab Reservation System project repository! This web application is being developed as part of our Major Course Output for CCAPDEV at De La Salle University.

# Project Overview:
The Lab Reservation System allows users to reserve seats in computer laboratories across our campus. The system aims to provide a seamless experience for students and lab technicians. As of the moment, our system is available for College of Computer Studies.

# What's Inside?
The project is divided into three phases:
## Phase 1: Frontend Development
In Phase 1, we are focusing on developing the frontend components of our Lab Reservation System. 
## Phase 2: Backend Development
In Phase 2, this involves developing the backend using Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB with Mongoose for the database.
## Phase 3
